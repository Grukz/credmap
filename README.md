credmap: The Credential Mapper
===

Credmap is an open source tool that was created to bring awareness to the dangers of credential reuse. It is capable of testing supplied user credentials on several known websites to test if the password has been reused on any of these.

### V2
Version 2 is a complete rewrite which uses the Splinter module (pip install splinter). You can use the PhantomJS driver for transparent requests, or the Chrome driver which makes debugging easier. This is still a work in progress.
